### CLOUD-INIT

# note: cloud_init_* is baked into LaunchConfigurations.
# to apply changes you must reload your LaunchConfigurations
# or use the 'update-lc' command

# add some additional cloud-init script commands before installing packages
cloud_init_pre: |
    touch /root/myapp_init
    # install AWS CLI tools
    yum install -y aws-cli

# run after your packages are installed
# note: it's a good idea to install the CodeDeploy agent last, because
# autoscaling lifecycle hooks to deploy on instance creation will do a
# deploy straight away, so you want your dependencies in place when that happens
cloud_init_post: |
    # install CodeDeploy agent
    cd /home/ec2-user
    aws s3 cp s3://aws-codedeploy-us-west-2/latest/install . --region us-west-2
    chmod +x ./install
    ./install auto
